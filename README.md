# Cory Klein's dotfiles

A personal fork of holman/dotfiles system for a better dotfile organization.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coryfklein/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
